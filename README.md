## Thoughts & Troubles
- My first project using PC
- I decided to work on this project fews days before exam to get familiar using Vscode and try out some new things i learnt like
  - using animated images
  - special fonts
- This project gave me so much headache as i encountered plenty issues and trying to navigate through.
  - My Css colors were not reflecting, i was stuck on this for like 3 days before i figured it was the PC display settings i needed to change
  - Couldn't figure out how to check for responsiveness on chrome as i was confused if i was supposed to use inspect and if it's on 50%,75% or 100%.
  - The PC's width is very wide so i was sizing the styles based on the width which gave me issues when checking for responsiveness
  - When I thought i was done and hosted the project, it was just all out of place when I checked it on other devices
  - Also the PC battery could not last 10mins unplugged so it was annoying coupled with trying to solve the issues I'm encountering
  - Some many other bugs encountered but i was able to understand how most things work in the course of this project
  - I decided to leave it, focus on exams and continue learning
  - #### ` This project has been rebuilt using it to lay my hands on Tailwind CSS `
